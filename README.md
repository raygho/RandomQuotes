# RandomQuotes
Want a random quote, use this function to deliver a quote for the day

This is a python function that delivers a quote and the author of the quote from the BrainyQuote website.
The way it works is that it uses web requests and scrap libraries to grab information from the website.
The function will store the data into two lists, (a) the list of quotes and (b) the list of authors accordingly. 

You can modify the script so it doesn't request data every time you run, rather it makes a call to the list for a quote and an author.
